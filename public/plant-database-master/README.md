## About

This is a ripoff of the HHCC Xiaomi Flower Care plant database.

The Mi Flora plant sensor is an amazing and affordable little BT Low energy plant sensor that measures the soil temperature, moisture and conductivity along with the light levels.

Sadly, the HHCC Flower Care app is extremely limited. 
For instance it is very difficult to manage anything beyond a couple of sensors and each sensor can only be assigned to a single plant.
The app offers no interoperability with other software or services and requires the user to use their phone to sync and monitor each device. 
These limitations severally reduce the usefulness of these sensors.

This sensor has had its communication protocol reverse engineered and is used widely by users with home automation applications.
The problem is that without the plant database the information provided by these sensors is not as useful as it could be. 
My hope is that releasing this data will help the development community utilize this sensor to its full potential and will enable the database to be further refined and expanded.
